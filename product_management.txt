 +AEAAXw-blackaustin I never said my s5 was better .. I just want a real reason to buy it .. if they don't release a watch I'm getting the moto 360 lol 
 +AEA-Motorola moto has lost its market base in Nigeria and I would like to be a partner to resurrect its market share again . 
 The Moto 360 is officially coming soon to AT+ACY-T will join LG G Watch as second Android Wear offering http://t.co/WQzO3cBVon 
 +AEA-Subhash+AF8-ati9 No ... I don't think so :+AC0-) If someone gives me flowers I'll say are you ok ?? If he gives me Moto 360 I'll jump into his lap :+AC0-)

 Can I get a Moto 360 with the apple watch mechanics please ? 
 Gonna come out and say it . Moto 360 is way sexier than the Apple Watch . 
 +AEA-techsavvyed Looking like the SM for me could be the moto 360 will have to wait to see about battery life 
 RT +AEA-acarboni Guys we all know this thing looks just like a Galaxy or a Moto X right ? We have to be cool with that . We have to own that truth 
 +AEA-se7ensins I feel like if Apple wanted cutting edge they would have followed the moto 360 and gone circular . Rectangles on wrists is weird . 
 For myself I will be passing on the Apple Watch but will likely spring on getting the Moto 360 when it's next available for order . 
 When I can't ride I watch moto 4 and get bummed out 
 +AEA-PatrickNorton beauty is subjective I guess . I still think the Moto 360 is the best looking watch put there . 
 :( moto 360 doesn't work with windows phone +AEA-windowsphone will you be making a watch anytime soon ??

 If anyone actually thinks the Apple Watch is better looking than the Moto 360 they should seriously consider going to the eye doctor . 
 +AEA-mightyigor :+AC0-( and they will still have to queue to do that . I still love the moto 360 
 That being said I was expecting a slicker more futuristic design like Moto .. Perhaps I'll wait for the next generation 
 Those of you that voted A are in luck and we can't wait to see your order . These Handlebar logo +//0A4v/9AID//QCm- http://t.co/EJqJS1fUIC 
 RT +AEA-TheMacAdvocate I feel bad for the Moto 360 team . Imagine what was probably your greatest work become toilet paper . What do you do with that feeling ? 
 Anyone feeling disappointed with Apple's new phones should get a Moto X 2014 instead . 
 RT +AEA-acarboni Guys we all know this thing looks just like a Galaxy or a Moto X right ? We have to be cool with that . We have to own that truth 
 I'd still sat the moto 360 is the sexiest wearable out there . Sadly I would break any watch ever so no watch for me . 
 +AEA-rajatagr please let me know whether the MOTO G 2 gen has facility of recording call conversations 
 apple watch imo isnt that nice compared to the moto g . need to see more of it but honestly not impressed so far 
 I think ima just fuck with the moto x lbs unless I look into some more stuff about I phones and see if something surprises me 
 RT +AEA-acarboni Guys we all know this thing looks just like a Galaxy or a Moto X right ? We have to be cool with that . We have to own that truth 
 If the Moto 360 hadn't sold out I would have one right now :( 
 +AEA-clintonjeff who would have thought Moto would beat Apple on design . The watch is ugly 
 +AEA-niket I do not . Would love to try the 360 and the Hint . Was also going to order a Moto X . 
 What I+//0A4v/9AID//QCZ-ll do is buy a Moto 360 that doesn+//0A4v/9AID//QCZ-t work with my iPhone 6 just to spite both myself and my sanity . 
 +AEA-ianarundale it's not the revolution I was hoping for . Think the moto 360 has more to offer . Think this proves Apple have lost their mojo . 
 +AEA-kick069 i dont know anything about moto x so i dunno what happened ? 
 It breaks my heart to know that I'll never be able to trust you again . 
 Anyone know where I can try a Moto 360 on ? Not really planning on buying one but I'd like to see what it feels like . 
 im sitting here watching all these apple liveblogs and im just thinking what a 2014 Moto X would be like to own 
 Apple watch doesn't really catches up with the looks would prefer moto 360 +ACQ-AAPL +ACM-applelive 
 Apple+//0A4v/9AID//QCZ-s watch design doesn+//0A4v/9AID//QCZ-t match Moto+//0A4v/9AID//QCZ-s efforts at all . It isn+//0A4v/9AID//QCZ-t sexy . It screams +//0A4v/9AID//QCc- I DO MORE THAN TELL TIME +//0A4v/9AID//QCd- as opposed to blending in . 
 +AEA-flipkartsupport Order ID is : OD40803004041 . I didn't know earlier that the charger doesn't belong to Moto G +ACE- Plz help me out +ACEAIQ- 
 This Apple watch is going to piss me the fuck off . The Moto 360 murders it but no one cares . 
 +AEA-benpreston123 i didnt say im going to buy smart watch but if i had to choose one i would pick moto 360 
 I don't need or really want a smart watch at this point but I think the moto 360 and Apple Watch are a good starting point . 
 I don't like the Apple Watch . It's square +ADs- end of conversation . Moto 360 looks the nicest but the dead pixels may have ruined it for me . 
+ACI-+ACIAIg- the first company to deliver a smartwatch that looks great and can last all day ( something the Moto 360 couldn't quite pull off ) . +ACIAIg-+ACI-
 +AEA-obox I think they will be holding stuff back until closer to the launch . Don't get me wrong though I think the moto 360 looks fantastic +ACE- 
 I been getting by with a Moto G . Works great . Does everything my old iPhone does . That doesn+//0A4v/9AID//QCZ-t mean the 6 won+//0A4v/9AID//QCZ-t give me a better experience .

 Can't wait to use my new moto g phone later and pretend I'm back in 2005 using a motorola razor 
 Don't like that watch . Not a patch on the moto 360 which means I'm goosed if I move back to the iPhone +ACM-apple 
 RT +AEA-maail I don't like it . :+AFw- Would have prefered it to be round . Moto 360 looks better . 
 If only the apple watch was round instead of square . Still have to vote for moto 360 as the better looking smart watch out there 
 I am never gonna have closure . Closure doesn't exist .

 +AEA-EdKensington It would take a ton to bring me to the apple side . I'm still leaning towards buying a Moto X this month . 
 I'm hoping I can slowly start saving up for the Moto X as soon as I start my new job . 
 Just checked out the Moto 360 have to agree with those who say it looks nicer than the Apple Watch . 
 People going on about the Apple Watch haven't seen the Moto 360 which is something I feel I could wear without looking like I'm in Star Trek

 If the Apple Watch looked more like the Moto 360 i think I'd go for it but tempted by that still +ACM-applewatch 
 +AEA-jamesmichiel For sure . Was hoping it would be able to . Agree the price is steep . Especially compared to the Moto 360 .
