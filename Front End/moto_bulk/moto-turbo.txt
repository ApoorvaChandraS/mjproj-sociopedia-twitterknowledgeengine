Moto Martin is a French engineering company, started by Georges Martin, known for its motosport inspired or Caf racer style racing frame kits for motorcycles. The original Moto Martin frame designs were based on the work of Fritz Egli. The company also manufactured its own wheels, body kits and, later, kitcars. Georges Martin capitalized upon building kit cars at a time when many riders in Europe couldn't afford to build their own modified cars. One model is known as a KZ900 Turbo. Cycle World in 1987 stated that "Moto Martin's products have a reputation for high-quality construction that places them above the level of most other frame manufacturers." Moto Martin motocycles have been compared to the likes of Bimota, Harris, Nico Bakker, and Honda RGB.
