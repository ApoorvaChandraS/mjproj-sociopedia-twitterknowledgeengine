Motorola Mobility is an American telecommunications equipment corporation headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. It was formerly Motorola's cellular phone division, which was called the Personal Communication Sector (PCS) prior to 2004. It pioneered the flip phone with the StarTAC in the mid-1990s. Motorola had a commanding lead in the analog cellphone market, but it was slow to embrace digital technology. By the turn of the 21st century, it produced another successful product, the (original) Razr, a very thin flip phone. Most recently, it has produced smartphones and tablets using Google's Android operating system. The division also handled the production of cable modems and set-top boxes for digital cable and satellite television services. On January 4, 2011, Motorola's mobile device and set-top box division was spun off into a separate company as Motorola Mobility, while the remainder of the company was renamed Motorola Solutions.
Shortly after the split, Google, the lead developer of Android itself, announced in August 2011 that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion, subject to regulatory approval. Google's intent for the purchase was to acquire the company's portfolio of patents so it could adequately protect other Android vendors from lawsuits. The deal closed in May 2012, after which it also sold its set-top box business to Arris Group. In late 2013, Motorola notably launched two new smartphones, the Moto X and Moto G, and unveiled Project Ara, a concept for a modular smartphone. Google's ownership of Motorola would be short-lived, as the company announced in January 2014 that it would sell most of Motorola Mobility to Chinese personal computer maker Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The deal is set to close by 2015.
