Flipkart is an Indian electronic commerce company founded in 2007, by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal. It operates exclusively in India, where it is headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka. It is registered in Singapore, and owned by a Singapore-based holding company. Flipkart has launched its own product range under the name "DigiFlip", offering camera bags, pen-drives, headphones, computer accessories, etc.
Legally, Flipkart is not an Indian company since it is registered in Singapore and majority of its shareholders are foreigners. Because foreign companies are not allowed to do multi-brand e-retailing in India, Flipkart sell goods in India through a company called WS Retail. Other third-party sellers or companies can also sell goods through the Flipkart platform.
