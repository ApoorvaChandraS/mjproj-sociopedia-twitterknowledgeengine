MotorBrands USA, Inc. is a t-shirt design company known for its original hand-drawn muscle car art. Part of the 1970s retro t-shirt revival, MotorBrands produced slim fitting vintage style t-shirts displaying popular muscle car art of that period. MotorBrands designs are reproduced using the same pen and ink techniques traditionally used in commercial art before the advent of computer graphics.
Some examples of muscle car t-shirts:
"Dodge Super Bee"
"Hemi"
"Screaming Chicken"
Recognized in American pop culture as a retro t-shirt brand, MotorBrands products have been worn by celebrities like Juliya Chernetsky (aka Mistress Juliya) and Marianela on "Fuse TV," band members from Soilwork on the OzzFest Tour," Johnny Kelly from Type O Negative, Brian Van Holt in Warner Bros. "House of Wax" starring Paris Hilton, Justin Timberlake on "Saturday Night Live", AJ McLean from Backstreet Boys on "Oprah Winfrey," just to name a few.
