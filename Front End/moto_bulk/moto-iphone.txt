iPhone 5C (marketed with a stylized lowercase 'c' as iPhone 5c) is a touchscreen-based smartphone developed by Apple Inc. It is one of two successors to the iPhone 5 and one of two predecessors to the iPhone 6, along with its higher-end counterpart, the iPhone 5S. Apple held an event to formally introduce the iPhone 5C and 5S on September 10, 2013, and they were released on September 20, 2013, therefore discontinuing sales of the previous iPhone 5, although it was the first iPhone to be released to GSM carriers such as T-Mobile since the iPhone 4.
The 5C originally shipped with iOS 7, Apple's mobile operating system. The current version of iOS for the iPhone 5C is iOS 8. The 5C uses much of the same hardware as the iPhone 5, with some iOS 7 optimization like slightly improved battery life and software-hardware color coherency. However, there are a few differences from the original iPhone 5. The 5C uses a hard-coated polycarbonate casing instead of the metal used by the 5 and 5S, and it has a black glass front instead of a white glass front. The 5C lacks many of the new features from the 5S; it uses the previous A6 chip from the iPhone 5 instead of the 64-bit A7, does not have the M7 motion co-processor, does not include fingerprint recognition, does not support OpenGL ES 3.0, and lacks the Burst iSight camera mode (Burst mode is made available in iOS 8 for older devices, such as the iPhone 4s) and slow-motion video recording mode, although it does support photo-taking video recording and digital zooming. Similar to the 16 (2014 model), 32 and 64GB versions of the fifth generation iPod Touch models, the iPhone 5C contains colors: blue, green, pink, yellow, and white.
On September 9, 2014, the iPhone 5C was discontinued and was succeeded by the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
