Motorola Razr (styled RAZR, pronounced "razer") is a series of mobile phones by Motorola, part of the 4LTR line. They were first developed in July 2003 and were released in the market in the third quarter of 2004. The V3 was the first and main phone of the series.
Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone, but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006. Over the Razr's four-year run, the V3 model sold more than 130 million units, becoming the best-selling clamshell phone in the world to date.
The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeeding Motorola Razr2 series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr 2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m. However, Razr2 sales were not as good as the original, with consumers moving to competing products. Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones, the Razr appeal declined, leading Motorola to eventually drop behind Samsung and LG in market share for mobile phones. Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.
In October 2011, Motorola resurrected the Razr brand for a line of Android smartphones; the Droid Razr for Verizon Wireless, otherwise also known simply as 'Motorola RAZR' on other networks, improved variant Droid Razr Maxx. The new 'Razr' line shares the trademark thinness as well as stylized tapered corners with the original.
